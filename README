microDE is a micro desktop environment.

The main idea is that you can use shellscripts to set up your environment
how you want it, by starting certain applications with certain options based
on the hostname of the system or other factors (such as realtime kernel or not)
And also freedom to pick the WM you want and such.  and all that with
minimal configuration overhead. (xdg autostart desktop files for example are
bloated and not nearly as flexible) [background: have 1 vcs repository for
your $HOME, but yet, allow for very different workspaces. so you can use the
same $HOME on very different systems]

Much of the stuff is also related to launching an ssh-agent, loading your
ssh keys and setting up tunnels and proxies to trusted hosts.
either from a tty or inside X


Some things which are not configurable, are to be seen as "the way to go".
Such as the usage of xscreensaver, xmodmap and xbindkeys.
If there are profound reasons to disagree, these things will be made
configurable or replaced by better alternatives


== settings ==
set $WM to your window manager(s) that you want.
$WM will be executed directly

the code and examples = the documentation


== dependencies ==

xscreensaver
xmodmap
xbindkeys
