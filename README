microDE is a micro desktop environment.

## Goals
* adherence to the kiss principle, unix philosophy and xdg basedir spec (simple code, very flexible, simple txt configs
 - actually shell scripts that get sourced -, integration with other tools, choose your own WM/shell, etc)
* compatibility with multi-user scenarios in a secure way
* setup without root access (best practice for this? how to handle login?) (it shouldn't be a global configuration affecting all users)
* support console/shell and Xorg sessions equally.
* start ssh-agent and other programs (daemons, [non-]graphical tools, ..) at the
  appropriate time for maximum availability.
* have callback hooks to for example load ssh keys when the agent is started, start ssh tunnels/proxies, load apps when X is up, etc.
  This should work independently of the type of session (X vs shell).
* scriptability so you can do different things based on hostname, type of kernel being loaded, and so on.

## Potential pitfalls/design notes
* when doing startx from console, and lock screen in X -> ctl-alt-F1 -> ctrl-c gives you shell for that user
* when logging in to the system you need to be able to pick your session (X,
  shell, ..), autostarting apps etc as appropriate. but you should be able
  to switch from shell to X or vice versa without needing to re-login or
  restart non-graphical apps. and honoring the above problem (not just
  'startx' on console)
* xdg autostart desktop files for example are bloated and very inflexible
* the initial need for this arose when i started keeping my $HOME in VCS, and wanted to
  use the same home on many different systems, hence the scripts that setup
  a different environment based on hostname and such.

== settings ==
set $WM to your window manager(s) that you want.
$WM will be executed directly

the code and examples = the documentation

== dependencies ==
TODO make all of them optional.
they were seen as "should be the best for everyone" and hence mandatory but this is:
1) not compatible with shell sessions
2) overkill
